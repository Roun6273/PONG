Pong is a table tennis-themed arcade video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari
 and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by 
Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari
 co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.
 Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first 
home video game console.
